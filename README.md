PET project that was written with flask using pydantic, poetry, docker, alembic, postgres, sqlalchemy. Developed version is accessible via http://185.154.52.216/addingform. To launch the project you can use docker compose. In this way you need to create a .env file in main directory(where docker compose file is), where variables such as DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME should be placed. Fill it with your own values. Technically, for docker compose you need only DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME, but put them all to correct running further.
